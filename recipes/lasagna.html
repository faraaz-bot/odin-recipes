    <h3>How to make the best Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Tomato Sauce: Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large skillet or large pot and cook on medium-high until the meat is no longer pink. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, stir a few times.</li>
        <li>Make the Cheese Mixture: Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl and add the cottage cheese, a half cup of mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, and parsley.</li>
        <li>How to Layer Lasagna: Spread a cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 13-x-9- inch casserole dish, followed by four lasagna noodles, a third of the cheese mixture, and a cup of sauce, and repeat. Next, pour the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.<li>
